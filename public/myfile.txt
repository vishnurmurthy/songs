yo, yo, fuck 2dopeboyz and fuck nah right and any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
fuck you post-drake-ass cliche-jerking, la-slauson rapping fuck-nigga-ass hypebeast niggas
now back to the album

dr. tc:
well, tyler, hi, i'm dr. tc
and um, i'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
um, it's gonna be three sessions, today, tomorrow, and the next day
so, just tell me something about yourself
well look, if you don't talk, i mean these sessions are going to go slower

tyler, the creator:
this is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
some food for thought, this food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
my father's dead, well i don't know, we'll never fucking meet
i cut my wrist and play piano 'cause i'm so depressed
somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
this meeting just begun, nigga i'm satan's son

my mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
that i got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
are much important i'm getting angrier while recording
i'm feeling like the bulls, i've got a gang of wolves
odd future is children that's fucked up in they mental
simple but probably not, fuck 'em

i'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
drunk white girls the only way i'll get my dick sucked
suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'cause this album pack enough evil
that you can't fit inside a jansport
go to school with this

i go from ap to jc inside a fucking week
waking up with random girls like "yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
i stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
every time i walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
no to drugs i never spark it
i used to be bullied for honor classes by those that were slow as molasses
take this shit to school

raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
she still don't know i made sarah to strangle her
not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a wrangler
all because she said no to homecoming, demons running
inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
i'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares i caught
go to sleep

i wear green hats because i'm fortunately lucky
"fuck me," the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
with this state of mind, big moves, max keeble
i'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
a fucking sin or too illegal
play this shit in church

tyler, the creator and dr. tc:
i graduated without honors or fucking father
he died (i'm so sorry), no bitch, don't even fucking bother
i wanted a brother my mother i told her
but instead i got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
so both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
that's having our brains racing like dayton, wearing some fucking heelys

tyler, the creator:
i know you fucking feel me, i want to fucking kill me
but times i'm so serious, you think i'm silly
i'm doing big style willy couldn't touch eleven
seven, what's religion nigga? i am legend
i roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
i created of 'cause i feel we're more talented
than forty year old rappers talking about gucci
when they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
with the same problem, the only way to solve 'em
is to go to father's day convention with a gold revolver
life's a salad, i'm a toss it, eat that shit up, rick ross it
shit it out, bag it up, sell it, i'm so damn rebellious
'cause my mother let me do what i want
she wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
the shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
my father didn't give a fuck, so it's something i inherit
my mom is all i have so it's never meet the parents
when danielle or milan decide to fucking share
this confused boy, i wanna hug hoy
i'm bad for you kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
i'm bad milk, drink it

dr. tc:
well, um, it seems you had a lot to say
and uh, who knows i might feel as i'm evaluating

tyler, the creator:
my wrist is all red from the cutter
dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
is never that's equivalent to me and sarah
well that's not her fucking name, but i think this shit is clever
my niggas wanna know if i'm fucking, if i'm kissing
but i'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
with a tear they try to tell me but i never listen
'cause i don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
hopefully they see the talent i carry just like jimmy
losers can never win me, you can never offend me
my goal in life is a grammy, hopefully mama will attend the
ceremony with all my homies, i'm suicidal
this my zombie circus, i hope the majors heard this
fuck a deal, i just want my father's email
so i can tell him how much i fucking hate him in detail

dr. tc:
wow, um, so tyler if you had the chance to tell him something
what would you tell him?i'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than mexicans sprint over borders
i give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
at hamptons with fred hampton relaxin' at happy camper
it's the fuckin' financial aid at hamptons wasn't relaxin', i'm taxin'
"fuck 'em all!" i'm chantin', don't complain i'm just rantin'
fuck ranking, i'm the best, i'm the champion's chariot
i'm a liar like carrey in "liar, liar"
i'm dirtier than the sheets in the marriott, cable guy like larry
peter pan in my youth, fucking fairies
i'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
fuck it, odd future some nazis, black nazis don't copy
we perfect, you sloppy, huddled and slightly tacky
fucking lame on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
screw you like a black teen on judge hatchett
endotherms and jaguars, drug dealers and crackers
able students and slackers
i'm backwards like jermaine dupri in '93
escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl born in a ramp
that i ordered from ccs with some diamonds that's vvs
like i went to sierra leone in a homecoming dress
with some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
sup on my hat like that motherfucker frannie
white, red-headed bitch reminded me of annie
she dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
fuck you bunches here, never disrespect my family
that's for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
wasted fuckin' youth? all you old niggas antiques
we go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from randy
bitches like tia landry watching billy and mandy
motherfuckers wanna be odd but you can't be
sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot

i guess i gotta be a fuckin' hand-me-down rapper
from los angee area anytime i'm fuckin' landing
fuck 2dopeboyz and nahright, shout out to hype track
them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
guess i gotta do a fucking song with dom kennedy
get these fuckin' hip hop bloggers to start feelin' me
because i'm seventeen, compose my own beats
lyrically i'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
maybe i should buy some hundreds, wear some fuckin' skinny jeans
and follow in your footsteps like a motherfuckin' millipede
centipede, make songs about gucci and cigaweed
jerk with my friends like it's some motherfuckin' little league
no i ain't no fucking hipster, mister
no i'm not no fucking kid cudi, all my fucking fans love me
collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo

i'm drivin' in a stolen truck, and i'm probably fuckin' drunk
wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, dj unk
my nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(shut the fuck up!) who the fuck told me not to spoke?
fuck everybody here, everybody vanish, i'll manage
hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwitch
everybody listening can suck my dick in spanish
fuck you, faggot (fuckin' bastard)

yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
i was, i was probably angry, probably on my period
but um, i didn't mean to offend anyone, all right, i'm lying, ofhello, the hype is so mellow
bitch i'm dope and my pipe is so yellow
the blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
nigga fuck your role model bitch, i'm my own idol and
if you can't face it my nigga, you can ass it
my accessorize accessories bring out my assets
nigga they sound on acid, tablets
stussy's g-shock with my custom pair of 3d glasses
i suffer from adhd
i should win a fuckin' award for bein' me
beat bangin' the tom-toms
my producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck vons
ace the underdog, thrown 'em on the back bender
'cause i change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
eating belgium waffles with italian biscotts
i sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
and to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off
step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off
nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
so when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me
with gucci belts, gucci imprint from leather welts

i'm so dapper man, funky fresh dapper dan
i'm your favorite rapper fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
on the wall, tall on excursions, i'm a virgin of swap meets

i just got one request, stop breathin'i was taught to act my shoe-size, never my age
i always judge a book by the cover, never the page
i never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage

while half my mental belongs in a cage
the ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
if you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
selling my assets, i'm so damn illegal that i need to be arrest

well you ain't been looking through my eyes

i bet you've never seen a pig fly, no
right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
went to sleep at seven then we woke up from the dream
wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from supreme
so i guess that's where i hide my things
caged, and the wonder is seen
middle finger missing so i can not give a fuck
i can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
so i'm chasing the dreams, no realities
hoping that once you're ready you won't be too mad at me
but if so, i'll take the scorn and indeed happily
long as i can feel my heart tap like happy feet

fatherless kids orphans like me and domo is
a fuck that we will never give is like our pops
but what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit

the pigs fly away in the morning
but i ain't get to see you today
and if i wanna go outside
i gotta make sure that i can play here
i bet you've never seen a pig fly
i bet you've never seen a pig fly
i bet you've never seen a pig fly
well you ain't been looking through my eyes

i'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask sarah, i'm the rapist
i'm a fascist, fuck fashion, gucci belts is for them faggots
my hat is by jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem with the future
you can get a death wish just like atiba
fuck the biz apparent, odd future errant
i'm watching the berrics getting head from someone's parent
blind fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed that i'm sharing
in the force with the cyclops staring
i'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever so don't ask for no motherfuckin' ride when you see us
swim right past you, the shit-list said that i'm nutty such a cashew
'cause i jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
the shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
kill the jungle, let the cats loose
you didn't see me here if someone ask you

(that nigga got off)
hodgy beats

hodgy beats:
i want to feel her in every way
mary jane keeps me high like every day
bong, vaporizer in the sack now
stuck in my high, afraid of heights, i'm trapped
buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
she ain't got time to try and relieve ya
but she'll get all in your head, sativa

mike g:
we grind, these niggas asking for some promo
we sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
square circle jerks starting of moshpit
preaching to the poets, i'm an of prophet
no less profit, fiened when we drop shit
convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
it's that crack, give you something to sell
put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
thought she hot i swear, probably rougher than hell
and she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking chanel
light skinned women, all sex everything
think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
everything that we call flight, living life
this is everything that we call hype
i'm everything that they call nice
she in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
intimidated by niggas you can't be
i'm a g, and this is something you can't see
top ranked, number one my son
and she looking for them trees, baby we got some
and stay focused on the women and you get less done
it's ironic 'cause i always hear you talking about one
them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
how high? nigga, higher than the kites they fly

you're high as fuck, damni like my girls skinny with brains
i like my hoodies fucked with lane
i like my friends imaginary with no names
and i make music for the fuck of it, no fame
aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
tried to find ammo but it's none around town
so i went down south but i ended up north
uptown sittin' on cloud 9's white porch
and of course, my car's off course
you're so white, my blinkers don't work
i'm tryna let the force, be with you, i get you
music is my first, but i contemplate divorce
you make a nigga sing songs nice
you make a nigga's night turn day
and you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
it sucks that i didn't get the chance to say hello
i wanna eat you out like jello
and mess with your body like the base and the cello
and tell your mom i said hello, you wanna go to prom? (nigga hell no!)
fuck (shit) and another one, and on another one

another love song about shit
and i'll be rich if i get another diss
and maybe cupid won't miss

i like her l-i-k-e, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
but she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of x's and o's
i wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement
keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went
(tyler, what you doin'?) shut the fuck up
you gon' fuckin' love me bitch
but all i really want is a kiss on the cheek
in private, not public in the streets
and your cupcake i will eat and your toes
'cause i got a big fetish with the feet
i just want somebody i can see
you can be a gold digger, you ain't gotta love me
i'm serious, i don't ask for much
your heart literally is what i do want for lunch
now this shit is turnin' to a habit
i'm the burger king, i gotta have it my way
and truthfully girl you really make my day
i would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
and i can't even look the other way
your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
l-o-l laughin', you're a gold oscar and i'm just actin'
and i want your sin in my hole, and have our kids play supportin' role
climbin' up the pole, jack and the beanstalk, bitch it's gold
and i was in loath, i would never get over you, ever, sarah

another love song about shit
and i'll be rich if i get another diss
and maybe cupid won't miss

half your body layin' on my chest
the rest is in my stomach, that's includin' your breast
and i'mma just take another guess
now you probably wishin' that you woulda said yes
am i crazy? maybe, but fucked up is how i been lately
shit, i don't give a fuck, your family lookin' for you, wish 'em good luck
bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
now you stuck up in my motherfuckin' basement all bloody
and i'm fuckin' your dead body, your coochie all cummy
lookin' in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
what did you want from me? what did you want from me?they don't paint pictures, they just trace me

odd future, i'm your muthafuckin' sergeant
nigga, i'm in charge, i fuck with freshjive
'cause i get it, no charge, and bbc for the low price
no bargin', nigga that's a bargain
cow print t-shirt like muthafuckin' dog
on the muthafuckin' farm with cockadoodle doodles
i'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
and my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
felines on the freetime, i'm tossin' bitches' salads
and i'm eating up they croutons, erica to milan
we was flyin' to milan, was supposed to go to bangkok
until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
to soho, baby, milo so dope
the cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
niggas get the picture, i see, why?
(they don't paint pictures, they just trace me)

my nigga, no hook

in fact, my hat is in tact with the fubu poor over
nigga, you pull over, fuck a rover range
and i'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
and i'm the only fuckin' rapper without a chain
with a four finger ring like i can't spell my fuckin' name

birthdays, christmas my only fucking wishlish was cd's
and a new fitted instead i got some cd's
i hated, some ritalin, some white socks
i was hyper 'cause i didn't get attention from my real pops

father's day was the worst when it came to gifts
'cause i ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
now my momma mentioned the day before she would like
'cause she's playin' both roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right
i ain't look up to obama and nixon, i looked up to the hugo's and dixon's
the niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen
pushin' keys like them niggas that were bangin' on the keynes
my father never seen me, the nigga probably stevie
he bought me hoodie a couple albums
like that's gonna make up the years and the tears
and the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes
you fuckin' dicked out, i swear to god if i see you

the skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called
he said you're better without him, i'm not the only fuck
without them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up
take it to the shop, then what?
fuck it, mommas proud of her asmatic thin fuck
luck on my brim supreme keeps me warm
when the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
the bummer is the fact that i'm black
and i hang with white neos who's nero stays frio
now this consulor is tryna tell me that i'm emo, she don't give a fuck
d-low where's the trigger, i'll let this bullet play heroyou wouldn't do that tyler, kill yourself or anyone
you don't even have the balls to begin with
what you need is me, someone to talk to
uh, it's been a while since our last session
so, tell me what's been going on

i'm not a fucking role model (i know this)
i'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
since kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
these mothafuckas think i'm supposed to live up to something? shit
i'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
but getting more pussy 'cause i tell bitches i'm wood harris (as you should)
from philly to paris, i'm getting these weird stares
at skateparks and airports all in the year, it's weird
yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
he still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
but that's a whole fucking different argument, shit i got over it
and the couple bucks in my pocket, so now i could go buy
a couple hot pockets and grandmom could stop cooking
them nasty ass collard greens, pressures on me like this top hat
bastard intro, how the fuck i'm gonna top that?

okay, you guys caught me
i'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, i lied

(tc)
we know. you just want attention. you'll be fine

i tried to hard, huh?
made a couple thou' and i just don't know what to buy yet
the 'preme shit is free and i don't drink so fuck a wine set
nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
fucked in the head, i lost my mind with my virginity
oh that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper?
'cause i'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
i'm the star of the group (yeah)
so no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(bastard was good though) what you think i record it for?
to have a bunch a critics to call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
like i didn't make parade or inglorious
'cause i'm too scared to tell my friends the way i really fucking feel
of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
in the tombs of lara croft, i'm getting pissed off
message boards are on my dick, i need a pissing waiver
let me bust one in they mouth, i know they feel the flavor

(tyler)
can't they just be happy for me
like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams?
why they got to fucking hate?

(tc)
i think everyone's happy, everyone's in a dream
i think you're _____ tyler, you have to believe that

(tyler)
i ain't even skate anymore, i'm too fucking busy
i can barely kickflip now

(tc)
why? why is that? do you not have any free time on your hands?

(tyler)
what the fuck you mean "i'm not talented?"
you see the shit that i've been doing?

(tc)
i have. i mean, you're a brave person

(tyler)
i'm not that great of a rapper but
as a whole, i'm pretty cool, right?

people excited thinking shit is so tight
getting co-signs from rappers that i don't even like
what the fuck you want me to do? start to gobble his mic?
and start jackson him off until his cock's blasting off?
fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me
'cause i don't listen to the immortal of tech of the nique
and all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
on the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
i'd rather listen to badu and pusha the t
and some waka flocka flame instead of that real hip hop
that's bull of the sheet but they want to critique
everything that we, wolf gang, has ever released
but they don't get it (they don't, 'cause it's not made for) 'cause it's not made for them
the nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
but they do not have the mindset, that same as him
i'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

(tc)
it is, but tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word
that's very... that's a bad word

(tyler)
i'm not homophobic

(tc)
i mean, i don't think you are

(tyler)
faggot

(tc)
fine. well, since the last time we...

(tyler)
the fuck is a good performance?
i get on stage and i have as much fun as i can

(tc)
i mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun
but your twitter posts, just...
i mean, they're really random
and it's add

(tyler)
who doesn't have add?
well, i don't

(tc)
i mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance
and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?

(tyler)
i wish thebe was here

therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
they don't want to fuck with me 'cause i do not fuck with religion
you see that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
here, put this middle finger in your ear (i'd rather not)
when someone gets blamed (what?) cause some white kid had aimed his ak-47
at 47 kids, i don't wanna see my name mentioned

(tc)
i don't think anyone's going to mention
i don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you

college wasn't working and i wasn't working
so i was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
but i was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
cause the four days that i went, i wasn't learning shit
now i'm living dreams that i wanted since 8
i can afford to get my mother something on her birthday

(tc)
well, you explained to me that you were in school, but i...

they claim the shit i say is just wrong
like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
i'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
my life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
and when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians

(tc)
so... what are you saying, take advantage?
i mean, you've been doing pretty good
i've seen that...

i still live in my grandma's house
sell out a fucking show in london just to end up on couches
i hate my fucking life, but when i make that announcement
my hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
and then i am confused if i want in or just out
my friends really think i'm playing when i say i need counseling
i sit in grandmother's living room and just pout and shout loud
inside, sometimes i just want to die

(tc)
no you don't

(tyler)
odd future came from the bottom
and it's gonna take a couple armed armies trynna stop 'em
all you fucking lames don't have to like me
the devil doesn't wear prada, i'm clearly in a fucking white tee

that all i really want from you is that throat

it's a full moon tonight and these hoes ain't acting right
it's because i'm dracula bitch, swag, swag, swag
it's because, left brain, wolf haley, free earl, golf wangso, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
well, first off

my only problem is death
fuck heaven, i ain't showing no religion respect
brain damage, therapy's the only thing i regret
talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
but, i'm surprised i ain't pop off my top off
life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the glock's cocked
my hands trembled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead

i told her i'm her worst nightmare
this is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air
or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

when i was younger, i would smile a lot
i'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top
now i'm drunk driving, lap's full of the budweiser tops
life is a movie and you're just a prop
they begged me to stop but i listen like death drones
love? i don't get none, that's why i'm so hostile to the kids that get some
my father called me to tell me he loved me
i'd have a better chance of getting taylor swift to fuck me
annoying and i'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
i'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
feel like humpty, you hoping that i'll fall? fuck y'all
i'm ace, i'm parentless, i'm kinda arrogant
ignorant as fuck, defend people for the hell of it
because i am the devil, fucker get on my level
doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, supremes and markers
my life is ms. mo unique parker, but a little darker, i'll see you in a couple

tyler, here's some water man
you seem a little tense... how is thebe?

all because a nigga just don't give a fuck
parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
but fuck that, you're shitty parents, face it, suck it up
that's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh
feel like i missed my little brother growing up
feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
but this is golf wang, like he missed his family growing up
i got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bro
now i'm emo, so fuck it, i'm pouring up
but i never had a drink, "sydney, tyler's throwing up!"
my nigga jasper said if i drink and get drunk enough
i won't feel the feeling i be feeling when i'm sobered up
but that's a fucking lie, why would he say that i'm
as emotionally strained as travis when he's... (tyler, calm down)
don't look at me, i'm 6'5" about to fucking cry
about another guy, but this is golf wang, do or die
i finally had a family
domo's in another state, where the fuck is riley?
now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
but before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
fuck that! i hope you die in a fiery death
one ear i got kids screaming "o.f. is the best"
the other ear i got tron cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
so i can kill these levels of stress, shit
they say that i'm shock value
how about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
i haven't got around to telling my mom shit
'cause i don't know how to... (whoa)
all i want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
when mommy cusses out cousin, some knives get shown
now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
and hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
looking like a fucking monster from the twilight zone
then they wonder why i stay at travis pad with a backpack
for the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
and deodorant like this house is my home
i could live with the same hat
and the same flat-screen tv watching flapjack
and the same bacon and waffles on a nice saturday
where i skate with the same fucking friends at
didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"message from gza, oh, another one from plain pat"
email full of emails, i never write back
ain't kill myself yet, now i already want my life back

one shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
i'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
you're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
i'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
i'm barney, dinosaur harley of a human
'cause i'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
you niggas can't harm me cause you all know that
we at the fuckin' dirty lifer's laundry (tyler, calm down) nigga get off me

fuck off me man, fuck (what's got into you?)
i don't know, it's like i'm a different person at times
sometimes i'm fucking mad, sometimes i'm not (yeah, you..)
as though i got a fucking voice in my head
telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
i don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, tyler, huh?)
he tells me to do this shit that i don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)
tron catsatan's gettin' jealous of the wolves
the demons said they preferrin' us
books on not givin' a fuck is what they referrin' us
wolves, i know you heard of us; we murderous
and young enough to get the fuckin' priest to come and flirt with us
you niggas rap about fuckin' bitches and gettin' head
instead i rap about fuckin' bitches and gettin' heads
while you niggas stackin bread
i could stack a couple dead bodies
making red look like less of a color, more of a hobby
i'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
i fuck bitches with no permission, they tend to hate shit
brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
then proceed to sat her down when i go splatter in her chatterbox
'atta boy, odd future you're not in my cata'
gore torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
this the type of shit that make a chris brown wanna kick a whore
that make songs about the wet blockers, when it rains, it pours
i hate this, screamin' "fuck patience!"
got a nigga shakin' like the calmest fuckin' haitian
after chronic masturbation; askin' where mary kate went
i wanna be the reason why all lesbians hate dick
i'll make this damn bull winkle the red moose
game of duct, duct, duct tape with a dead goose
she run around this mothafuckin' dungeon, her legs loose
until i accidentally get this saw to her head, oops

rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome

nice to meet ya, but it's more pleasant to eat ya
with a leaf and salad and some dressing pourin' out a teacup
bitch, i'm tyler the creature, suck ya feet up like a beach of leeches
rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker whore
jeeper the fuckin' creeper, get ya daughter and keep her
in the jeep where the wolf gang rides around deeper
take her to ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the berrics
stare at steve say it koston to fuck eric
put her in the lake, her body seems great
now it's time to fish her, like derrick
satan's us, we're dangerous
we're tradin' kids for angel dust
snuff and sniff; now that michael jackson's tryna suck out dick
hippo to fuckin' llamas; dead bodies cheerleading squaders
gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the keke palmer
they will never catch him or catch up
they asked me what it was, i told them fuckers it was ketchup
nutty like my chex mix, she's bleeding from her rectum
odd future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up
this the type of shit that make children break in apartments
when you tell a fucking orphan you don't love him till they heart thins
starve heart till i carve her then shove her in the rover
where i cut her like a barber with a parkinson's disorder
store her in a portable freezer with me to portland
catch me with a bunch of fuckin' mexicans crossing the border
i'll be the only wetback who ain't really touch the water
'cause i'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with jesus' daughter
i'm awesome, and i fuck dolphins
sicker than the starving nigerian kids barfin'
odd future wolf gang nazi bar mitzvah
with ya sista at the bar playing leg and arm twister
evident that i'm the shit; i'm the pooh like tigger's dick
i got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah, bob, this nigga sick"
animal safari if i offend you, i'm sorry because
i'm the blackest skin head since india arie
i don't smoke weed so no need for matches
i said, "fuck coke", and now i'm snorting hitler's ashes
i plan on either dying from suicide or my asthma
being the only bastard in box logo casket
rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob sagets
in some kanye west glasses screaming out, "fuck faggots"
catch me in the attic taking photos of my dad's dick
drop the beat here to make it extra climactic(it's this girl)
she lives next door
to the store that i loiter at
we talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
and if we text, i get pissed when i get no reply

(it's this girl)
i know that she's the key to love
she is who i'm thinking of when i ain't beating richard up
the mental images her face looked
the closest that i got was when i'm poking her on facebook

(this girl)
video chats are so exciting,
'cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
i'm getting gassed up, i think she's liking me
she's gullible, and i just wanna take it like a pirate (aargh)

(this girl)
i see her in class
not really two doors down, but any time that i pass
to take a piss in a stall, i picture us in the hall
locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
my left hand on her tits, aw my shit's getting hard
some thoughts of dating this bitch

(it's this girl)
her name is my password (...fuck)

(this girl)
all my niggas got they bitches and stuff
but all the bitches, they fuck
i know these bitches is sluts
but she's special, i know to y'all i come off as rough
but i'm the nicest to her, and i just want to concur
a relation, i want the cheesy dates at the movies
and stupid walks at the beach, and sharin' straws in a cup
i never had that, so when we holdin' hands walkin' home
i look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that i hate
but...

(this girl)
things are looking great, cut copy
last time that we talked, she said her relationship was rocky
now that mr. faggot's gone, their's no one that can stop me
from bagging her, i got these tickets to the roxies

(this girl)
next day, metro's taking me home
i see her in a cut at wendy's, but she's not alone
who's that guy, wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
come to find out she got back with her... nigga...
(damn)
damn...
fuck...

(it's this girl) [x2]
she's so pretty, fuck self pity, i feel so shitty
i wanna text her in a jealous rage, but if she replied
or say anything, i'mma smile, i know

what do i do with myself? sit in my room for some days
play xbox with piles full of wet socks, fuck that

(this girl)

my nigga asked "ace, what happened to such and such?"
i her name, and then, tell em' i probably fucked
or i could tell 'em the truth and say she didn't like me much
but instead i lie and say she moved to nebraska...

(it's this girl...)(intro: tyler)
nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
fuck you think i made odd future for?
to wear fucking suits and make good decisions?

with nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns
those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
like ellen degeneres clitoris is playing with dick
i'm jealous as shit, 'cause i ain't got no home meal to come to
so, if you do, i'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
i got ten of these kennedy's
not dom, but if i was a dahm, i would be jeffery
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
i'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like i'm master p in '96

surprised she hasn't taked the nasty dick inside her alley you
the golf wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again
and showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again

me to see a shrink
started with a link
intended her to meet me at the local
odd future wolf gang skating rink
we be uniquely in sync
already fucking and we only met last week
we're both young, not yet antique
so her mindset was working for my technique
tell her that i love her and by next week
you can hear her shriek from the gas in her cheeks
well, i'm not a freak, i am meekly a greek that
neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
it reeks of a street girl
streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
oblivion makes obvious seats which
makes me swing my obvious feet

oh... fuck.crack fucked up the world, and i wonder if they realized the damage
i mean, i come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
i wonder if it fucked with their conscious
it fucked with me being out there, i couldn't stand it
i couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that
but that's where the money came from

48, 48, 48 states i get it in

your mother is a goner
i warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
you got a daughter, shits getting harder
the only thing you wanna bump her was your freedom
you can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep, and the seashore ain't soil
you got a mother, she don't support you
but you bought her a new house cause you love her
growing up you barely had a roof
now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
i guess you're accustomed to what you're used to
so you bought two, nigga
they are coming for you, nigga
niggas be hating i'm doing them bitches
like susan and karen be doing your pockets
and running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it's all an illusion
who was alludin' all of this potent
i am the reason your family is using and shootin' up, it's my fault,
you can blame me motherfucker, for killin' your aunties and uncles,
the hustle and hunger, all i wanted was a cheeseburger,
and a little chain tuck, didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
"oh how's ma?" my conscience eats it up all the time
but other than that i'm fine i got a little money in my pocket.

nigga, we broke as fuck
homie got a chop shop i sold that truck
and i sold that dope
motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
but like my work i give no fucks, i'm sorry
she could have been a doctor, nigga, i'm sorry
could have been a actor and won that oscar, said, i'm sorry
i sold that soap and i killed black folk, i'm sorry
but i got a nice car, put my sister through school
while my momma all cool, i'm sorry
i'm in too deep and i can't see the shore, i'm sorry

you get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
even more than the money, it's just your job
you feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
and make this happen for that person, to do this and do that
you become the go to guy forever
and next thing you know you're in too deep, way too deep
scare the shit out of you, you wind up with so much work
that you'll be scared to death
it's important for us to realize, man
we gotta get out of that, man
ya know, dudes is buying choppers
to shoot down people that look just like them
dudes is buying guns to take down each other
nobody wins
ya known what i mean?went to six flags, six fags came up and said, "ayo
can we get a pic?" i said no
and they said, "oh, it's wolf gang, 'yonkers'
goblin is my shit though"
now i'm like, "fuck, i don't want to be an asshole"
so i'm sitting there posing with travis, devon
with a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
so fucking annoyed 'cause i missed goliath
'cause some kid said i was there then they caused a riot
now i'm surrounded by a twenty-five hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
all because they noticed the top with the box logo
and them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear bastard
they bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
i'm going fucking loco, "hey, tyler, can i?"
no, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?

"but tyler, you're my hero, i used to get bullied
until i heard 'radicals,' the last part got to me
see, i used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
now i'm the happiest i think i'll ever ever be
my life is just like yours, no father
my mama must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
in school, i was the one thinking outside boxes
so everybody in them would say that i got problems
so when i heard you say it, i said it back like, 'fuck 'em'
you're an inspiration to niggas like me
not the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats
i'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
i heard the song 'bastard' right in the moment of heat
not in summer but of course i was holding a heat gun on the edge of my feet
i heard that first piano chord and it drew me in like predators carrying treats
then i said to myself, 'fuck, is he speaking to me?'
see, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
i mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
i carved of on it this morning with a glass shard
on my green mini ramp that i built in my backyard (that's weird)
that's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
when i see you play at the roxy (uh)
tyler, i love you, i wanna be just like you (all right)
i think about your face and i don't even fucking try to (no homo)
wish i had a basement meant for me to hide you
we could play xbox and listen to in search of... and eat donuts
over conversating bout what church does
come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
i'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
and raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
you should've took me instead (uh, that's weird)
see, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
and if i can't have you then she shouldn't either
no one should see you but me in your t-shirt
i worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt
odd future, wolf gang, golf wang, flog gnaw, free earl mobbing
i know it seems like just i'm slobbing on your knob
but i'm just a fan and i ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
i ain't got a job and i went out and bought goblin about five times
'cause (thanks for the support) i love you man (all right)
i like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
i like pants that's cut, i like words like 'fuck'
i got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck?)
and i hit you on twitter about ten minutes a day
and now i'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a, 'hey' (sorry)
and my boys think i'm gay 'cause i play 'vcr'
in my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors"

all right my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
so i can get on colossus, line as slow as molasses
(tyler, listen) no, nigga, i see you're loving my shit
and i appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
but i'm not gay so it's awkward, now i'm grouchy like oscar
after spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige dockers
"yonkers" and "yonkers" (i love that song), sick of hearing about "yonkers"
i'm grateful that it worked, i attacked and i conquered
"yeah whatever but i had a fucking blast at that concert
i was at the boston one, i got a t-shirt from sagan
the one that say, 'sagan lockhart' and when you came out to 'sandwitches'
that's when my fucking boycrush got started"

just take this fucking picture man, shituhm, i said, the party isn't over
we can still dance, but i don't have no rhythm
so fucking take a chance with me
the party isn't over, we can still dance girl
but i don't have no rhythm
so fucking take a chance with a nigga
like me, like me

uhm, i said, the party isn't over
we can still dance, but i don't have no rhythm
so fucking take a chance with me
the party isn't over, we can still dance girl
but i don't have no rhythm
so fucking take a chance with a nigga
like me, like me

yeah, uhm
all i needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
mother fuckers getting lynched and burned
i earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good
on this brand new jacket
the donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
hurry, quickly i need a piece of hersheys
darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
i centered the mellow over the graham
heated it too long now it's melting over my hand
fuck it, i'll bite it, i burnt it, but i liked it
camping with my niggas, it's so fucking exciting

we're making smores by the campfire
camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer

sat by the fire, do witness gentle
transformation cease to be mindless

in a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather
sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether or not they got one
tried to change their life for the better
i was the drama club kid, i run where the fun did, my nuts itched
i was defiant, always said, "fuck shit"
hated the popular ones, now i'm the popular one
also hated homes too, till i start coppin' me some
see i don't beez in the trap, nigga, i beez in the b's
and i be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a shell
fucking sick and getting bigger like i sneezed on adele
and bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille
i bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
i tried to tell the kids like, "fuck it, start being yourself"
these fucking rappers got stylists 'cause they can't think for themselves
see, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
really, boy? poseurs looking silly, boy
i'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than tity boi
not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is diddy riese
na'kel smith, transworld page sixty-four
poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
i'm harder than dj khaled playing the fucking quiet game
the fuck am i saying? tyler's not even a violent name
about as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
but he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
god damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
and my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens
see y'all niggas tripping, man

look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
saying i hate gays even though frank is on ten of my songs
look at that mom who thinks i'm evil, hold that grudge against me
though i'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
look at the kid who had the nine and tried to blow out his mind
but talk is money, i said, "hi," i guess i bought him some time
look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?
they thought i wasn't fair until i threw a carnival, huh?
but then again, i'm an atheist that just worships satan
and it's probably why i'm not getting no fucking album placements
and mtv could suck my dick, and i ain't fuckin' playing
bruh, they never played it, i just won shit for they fucking ratings
analog fans are getting sick of the rape
all the tron cat fans are getting sick of the lakes
but what about me, bitch? i'm getting sick of complaints
but i don't hate it when i'm taking daily trips to the bank
oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what i think?
my fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
fuck buying studio time, i'mma go purchase a shrink
record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

our conversations brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak
and i'm not talkin' days bruh, i'm talkin' 'bout her strife
i sat there 20 minutes tops, hopin' it was just a fuckin' plea that she could cop
she died that night

suckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair
fastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
probably couldn't tell but i be blushing when you with me
when you kiss me, swear to god, blood was rushing to my jimmy, oh
laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
from my fake space fog machine
laying on my arm, it's dead
from the pressure of your head
i said i loved you, said it back
like it was scripted, but you meant it
like the flavor of that lemonade
that we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
oh, you think you special now?
other bitches trippin' now
'cause we're fleeing to the moon
fuck earth, man we sick of y'all
wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah

oh yeah

oh yeah, let's go to the moon!

to another place
another day
we in outer space
we'll waste our days
sade, sade, sade (sade)
oh, right now ([?])

(?)
(it's about to start)now when i first saw you
i could tell you was the one
that i've been searchin' for
i needed somethin' that was like the sun
now all my flowers grow
right now my life, it blooms, baby

you're my favorite color, my favorite color
my favorite color's you
it's like the endless summer, endless summer
whenever i'm with you
cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellowhow many cars can i buy till i run out of drive?
how much drive can i have till i run out of road?
how much road can they pave till they run out of land?
how much land can there be until i run in the ocean?
you niggas go with the motions and all the plans
sea i was never into the beaches and all the sands
see, i was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
falling outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if i swam to cool down
how much cooler can i get until i run out of fans?
how many fans can i have until i turn on the ac?
if the ac blows, well then i'm tnt, i'm gone

i'm gone and i'm finished
and i ain't seen my friends in a minute
guessing nothing lasts forever
yeah, nothing lasts forever
nothing sticks together
sick of sitting in doubt
please let me figure this out

shout out to the girls that i lead on
for occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
and trying their hardest to keep my head on straight
and keeping me up enough till i had thought i was airborne
how many raps can i write till i get me a chain?
how many chains can i wear till i'm considered a slave?
how many slaves can it be till nat turner arise?
how many riots can it be till them black lives matter?
niggas click clack splatter, pew, pew that nigga
life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'cause when i get pulled over, i usually play it cool
'cause i know what i'm driving is usually paid in full
and my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
because i got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
them views get some stares and my backyard does too
and if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
you better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
and that's what i swim in

and if i drown and don't come back
who's gonna know? (baby, then i'll know)
and if i crash and don't come back
who's gonna know? (baby, then i'll know)
and if i fall and don't come back
who's gonna know? (baby, then i'll know)
i'm wondering if i don't come back
maybe then i'll knowayo
let's take it back to them days
counting sheep on sadie hannah's floor
carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee i poured
rent-a-center calling everyday
nobody home, they're knocking on the door

but don't be too cool, you may freeze
because niggas get stuck in the cold (man, look at this ice)
shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
(stunt on these niggas)
tell these black kids they could be who they are
dye your hair blue, shit, i'll do it too
look, i smell like chanel
i never mall grip with my manicured nails
i coconut oil the skin
i keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
but other than that, man, it feels like i'm winning
went from statistic to millionaire
cnn doubted 'cause my skin is dark
but they forget when i get in my car

i'm leaning out the window
oj shining on me
simp sun shining on me
slick circles floating
vro we off this world
run it, run it, run it, yeah

(let's go!)

flower boy t, nigga that's me
rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
took a little while, nigga making leaves
keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat
favorite color green, energy is strong
giving niggas life like birdies and the beez
dropping them seeds, not what you want
you don't know what i keep in the trunk... tree

ah, shit!

run it, run it, run it, run it

"it's golf radio, you're on the air with shane powers
taking requests... what's uh... what's your name? hello? um, okay, well, since, you want to be mr. fucking secret agent, what song you wanna hear?"

the one about meokay, okay, okay, okay
okay, okay, oh

you live in my dream state
relocate my fantasy
i stay in reality
you live in my dream state
anytime i count sheep
that's the only time we make up
you exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
i don't wanna wake up

20/20, 20/20 vision
cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
wonder if you look both ways
when you cross my mind, i said, i said
i'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
you're the one that's always running through my day dreams, i
i can only see your face when i close my eyes
can i get a kiss?
and can you make it last forever?
i said i'm 'bout to go to war
and i don't know if i'ma see you again

i said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
is translatin' to another form of what you call it? - love
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, i ain't met you
i've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore i stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
you don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
it's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
yeah i'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
yeugh!
